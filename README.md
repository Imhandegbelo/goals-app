# Goals App

This app was bootstrapped with React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To run the app locally:
* Clone the repo
* Install node_modules at the root and in the `frontend` directory using
  ``` bash
  npm install
  ```
  or
  ``` bash
  yarn
  ```
* create a `.env` folder at the root and populate it

The 'Goals App' is a fullstack app with the following functionality
Users can:
* Register
* Login
* create goals
* Delete goal
* View their goals on Dashboard
* Edit goals (yet to be implemented)

In addition, a logged in user can:

* Create goals
* Update goals
* View goals
* Delete a particular goal

The endpoints are:
| Endpoint | action to perform |
| ------- |-------- |
